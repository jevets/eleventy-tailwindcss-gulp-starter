# eleventy-tailwindcss-gulp-starter

A starter project for static site generated with [@11ty/eleventy](https://11ty.io/) using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) tasks.

## Eleventy I/O

*I/O is different from 11ty's default input/output.*

Eleventy is configured to use `./src` as its input, and `./dist` as its output.

These are set as variables in both `.eleventy.js` and the main `gulpfile.js`, so you can easily change them if you need different directories.

## Install

Clone the repo, then run `yarn` or `npm install`.

## Build

`yarn build` or `npm run build`

## Dev watch / server

One command will watch all your files and run a local development server on port 8000 (default for [`gulp-webserver`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-webserver)).

## CSS

See `./tailwind.js` and `./src/css/app.css` to customize CSS.

The Tailwind config file is the package's default, generated by its [built-in `init` script](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation#2-create-a-tailwind-config-file).

The `app.css` file is bare bones.

### Purge and Minification

TBD
